# Bio Chem Viewer

For viewing and performing minor edits on moleculars; espsecially proteins and nucleic acids.

Conceptually similar to [PyMol](https://www.pymol.org/). Much less functionality. Much faster. Intuitive, flexible camera controls.

## Functionality

- Viewing proteins and other molecules' 3D structure



## Goals
- Fast
- Easy-to-use


## The camera

The camera controls operate on the perspective of the viewer, vice the molecule. You can move and rotate the camera
in 6 degrees of freedom, allowing you to easily view the molecule from any perspective.

Camera Hotkeys:
- W: Move camera forward
- A: Move camera right
- A: Move camera left
- D: Move camera back
- Space: Move camera up
- C: Move camera down
- Q: Rotate camera counter-clockwise
- R: Rotate camera clockwise

- Left arrow: Select previous residue
- Right arrow: Select next residue

- Shift (left): Hold to increase camera movement and rotation speed.
